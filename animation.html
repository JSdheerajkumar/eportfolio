            This project involved creating a 15-second animated video using Adobe Animate to demonstrate the fundamental principles of magnetism. 
            The animation visually illustrates how same poles repel and opposite poles attract, utilizing smooth motion tweens, labeled visuals, and transitions to ensure clarity and engagement. 
            I designed distinct red and blue poles for the magnets to make them easily recognizable, complemented by text overlays like "Same Poles Repel" and "Opposite Poles Attract" to reinforce the core concepts. 
            To enhance the overall aesthetic, I incorporated a subtle yellow gradient background and applied fade-in/out effects for smooth transitions between scenes.

            The project presented several challenges that required creative problem-solving. 
            As a beginner in Adobe Animate, I had to quickly learn its features, particularly managing registration points for accurate motion and simulating 3D effects without the 3D Rotation Tool. 
            Synchronizing the animations with the text, organizing a crowded timeline, and troubleshooting issues related to export quality were also key hurdles. 
            Despite these challenges, I successfully delivered a polished and visually engaging video that effectively explains magnetic forces in a simple and concise manner.

            Through this project, I gained valuable experience in using Adobe Animate, deepened my understanding of animation principles, and honed my problem-solving skills. 
            I also learned the importance of balancing technical accuracy with creative design to create an educational resource that is both informative and engaging for viewers. 
            This project exemplifies my ability to combine technical concepts with visual storytelling to communicate complex ideas effectively.
