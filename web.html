                A background image of Michael Scott with his "Worldâ€™s Best Boss" mug brings instant recognition, while the simple, office-themed design uses Helvetica for readability and a light yellow quiz container reminiscent of office stationery, with golden buttons inspired by Dundies awards.
                The design approach prioritizes a visually appealing, user-friendly interface, with elements organized for a natural flow and balance. 
                Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the quiz includes interactive features and playful, themed feedback for an enjoyable fan experience.</p>

            <p>This Binge-Watchers' Trivia drag-and-drop quiz challenges users to match famous TV quotes with the correct series, featuring iconic lines from shows like The Big Bang Theory, Grey's Anatomy, The Office, and Friends. 
                Hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access and updates, the quiz offers a visually appealing, user-friendly interface with a lavender theme and clear series boxes as drop zones for quotes.
                The design uses a soft lavender background and playful "Fredoka One" font, enhancing the quiz's friendly vibe. 
                A pastel color scheme brings harmony, with lavender for primary accents, pastel green for correct answers, and light coral for incorrect feedback. Rounded corners and subtle shadowing on containers add a polished, modern look. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this quiz combines functionality with inviting aesthetics, creating an enjoyable experience for TV fans.</p>
