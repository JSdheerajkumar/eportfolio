                This project is a fun, interactive quiz designed for fans of The Office. 
                Participants match iconic quotes from the show with the characters who said them, creating an engaging experience that celebrates the humor and charm of the series. 
                Hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access and seamless updates, the quiz features a design inspired by the show’s unique style. 
                The background image of Michael Scott holding his “World’s Best Boss” mug sets the tone, while the quiz container’s light yellow color, reminiscent of office stationery, adds a subtle thematic touch. Golden buttons, inspired by the Dundie Awards, enhance the playful, nostalgic feel. 
                The clean, simple layout uses Helvetica for readability and ensures an intuitive and enjoyable user experience.

                <br>
                The quiz was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating interactive elements to bring it to life. 
                Themed feedback messages and playful animations add a layer of fun for participants, making the experience more engaging. 
                I focused on ensuring a smooth flow and balanced layout by organizing elements logically and prioritizing user-friendliness.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Through this project, I learned how to combine design principles with functional interactivity to create an enjoyable experience. 
                It also enhanced my skills in developing responsive, visually appealing web applications and managing deployment through GitHub Pages. 
                Additionally, this project deepened my understanding of how thematic design can significantly elevate user engagement and create a memorable experience for a specific audience.</p>

            The Binge-Watchers' Trivia is a drag-and-drop quiz that challenges users to match famous TV quotes with their corresponding series. 
            Featuring iconic lines from beloved shows like The Big Bang Theory, Grey’s Anatomy, The Office, and Friends, this quiz is designed to entertain and engage TV enthusiasts. 
            Hosted on GitHub Pages, it is easily accessible and regularly updatable. 
            The quiz’s design focuses on simplicity and charm, with a lavender-themed interface and intuitive drop zones for quotes. 
            A pastel color scheme complements the playful "Fredoka One" font, enhancing the quiz’s friendly and inviting vibe. 
            Visual elements such as rounded corners, subtle shadows, and color-coded feedback (pastel green for correct answers and light coral for incorrect ones) create a polished, modern aesthetic.

            <br>
            Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the quiz combines interactive functionality with user-centered design principles. 
            Users drag quotes to designated series boxes, and the quiz provides immediate, themed feedback. 
            Careful attention was given to ensuring responsive design, a seamless drag-and-drop experience, and visually appealing transitions to maintain user engagement.

            This project taught me how to blend functionality with aesthetics to create an enjoyable, user-friendly experience. 
            I honed my skills in JavaScript for interactivity, CSS for crafting polished designs, and GitHub Pages for hosting and deployment. 
            Additionally, this project highlighted the importance of cohesive theming in creating an immersive experience tailored to a specific audience, furthering my ability to design interactive, engaging web applications.
