            <img src="bookcover.jpg" alt="Image Editing Example 1" class="content-image">
            <p>For the cover of Benares: A World Within a World by Richard Lannoy, I drew inspiration from my recent visit to Kashi, India—a spiritually enriching experience. 
                The warm color palette, featuring ochres, deep oranges, and golds, reflects Kashi’s vibrancy and spiritual warmth. 
                Key elements such as the sacred trishool, ghats, and Banarasi silk draped figures represent the layered cultural richness of Benares, where the spiritual and everyday converge. 
                I used photo manipulation, layering, and subtle background textures to unify the visuals, creating a seamless blend that captures the city’s essence. 
                The stylized typography adds a traditional touch, completing the cover’s timeless feel.</p>

            <h3>Logo</h3>
            <img src="Logo.jpg" alt="Image Editing Example 2" class="content-image">
            <p>The logo for The Great Indian Silk captures the rich cultural heritage of Benaras through a design inspired by the iconic betel leaf, symbolizing authenticity and tradition. 
                Shaped like this leaf, the logo uses a deep green color to represent natural, sustainable elements tied to Benaras' cultural practices and silk craftsmanship. 
                Within the leaf is an intricate zari-inspired pattern, evoking the luxurious golden threadwork of Benaras silk, adding elegance and aligning the logo with the fabric’s traditional and ornate qualities.
                The design blends traditional symbols with a modern aesthetic: beginning with the betel leaf outline, refined into a minimalist vector shape, then incorporating decorative floral motifs inspired by zari embroidery. 
                Final touches include line art in green, capturing a balance between simplicity and the luxurious essence of Benaras silk. This approach encapsulates the timeless artistry of Benaras silk in a clean, sustainable, and sophisticated logo.</p>
